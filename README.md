# FaceDetectionDemo
A quick demo using OpenCV for face detection and image processing in python.

Dependencies:
`cv2`

Usage:

Face Detection script can be run by typing

`python facedetect.py`

then a window should pop up labeled "img" which will be using your webcam to track your face live! You might need to let the terminal access your video camera feed in your settings.

Cartoonification script can be run by typing

`python cartoon.py`

which will convert "image2.png" into a cartoonified image.
